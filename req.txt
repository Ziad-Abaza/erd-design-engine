Feedback / Behavior Note on Table-Level Handles:

Delayed Activation Issue:
The table-level connection points do work, but only after several attempts to create a connection.
On the first attempt, connecting points between tables often fails. After a few tries, the connections start working consistently and can be used smoothly with any table.

Expected Behavior:
The handles should be fully functional from the very first attempt, without requiring multiple tries. This will improve usability and reduce confusion for users.
